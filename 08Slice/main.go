	//! Append from the back of the "slice"
	fruitList = append(fruitList, "Tomato", "Banana", "Grapes")

	fruitList = append(fruitList[1:])

	fmt.Println("Used all the indexed now result is", highScores, "we cannot add more elements into slice by traditional method")

	//! In this method we can dynamically addon elements without get effected by already declared range of slice. Cause append method will relocate all the elements to different memory location and add new elements into it and this time we can append lot of values into an slice.

	highScores = append(highScores, 33, 443, 85)
	fmt.Println("After append into slice the final result is :-", highScores)

	//! We can sort this slice with built in package sort
	sort.Ints(highScores)
	fmt.Println("After sort a slice in increasing order the result look like :-", highScores)

	fmt.Println("This will tell slice is sorted or not by showing boolean value :-", sort.IntsAreSorted(highScores))
